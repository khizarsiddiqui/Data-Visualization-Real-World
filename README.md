# Data-Visualization-Real-World
Python program to work with real-world data sets extracted from CSV and JSON file formats.
This is a simple data set that contains only precipitation and temperature-related data. When you download your own weather data, you can choose to include a number of other measurements relating to wind speed, direction, and more detailed precipitation data.

# strptime()
Python interprets '%Y-' to mean the part of the string before the first dash is a four-digit year; '%m-' means the part of the string before the second dash is a number representing the month; and '%d' means the last part of the string is the day of the month, from 1 to 31. The strptime() method can take a variety of arguments to determine how to interpret the date. Table 16-1 shows some of these arguments.
